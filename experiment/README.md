### Data Preprocessing
   - Map each node to consecutive integers, starting from 1.
   - Split train set and test set according to samples ratio 0.75: 0.25.
   - Eliminate unseen nodes in test set to remain comparison fairness.
   - Unifiy train set and test set. Draw negative samples from other nodes except current node.

### Node2Vec
   - Use only training embeddings.

### GraphSAGE
   - Use only random sampled training adjacency list.

### Dynamic Triad
   - Equally divide into [32,8,4] snapshots, use previous snapshot embeddings to predict current snapshot links.
   - **ia-enron-employees** when stepsize is set to 8, it gives error "We don't expect any node connect to all other nodes". So I copy embeddings from stepsize 4 to stepsize 8.
   - **ia-frwikinews-user-edits** when stepsize is set to 1, it runs on 207 and gives error "Resource are exhausted". So I use CPU to run triad.
